              In India, the legal profession is not only known for attractive
              packages but it is known for legal reformations for the people of
              India. Whether making amendments for fast-track court trials for
              special cases, fighting for the rights of minority communities,
              or, crucial discussions in the passing of bills and acts, the
              contributions cannot be overlooked
