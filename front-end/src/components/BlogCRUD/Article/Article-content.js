      `The United Nations has always been of the opinion that the most effective and efficient way to put an end to human suffering and atrocities faced by people is to put a full stop to conflicts in the first place. With this view, history has witnessed the creation of multiple statutes and treaties with the objective of ensuring world peace. Especially, the post-COVID world requires all the nations to move forward in a united manner in order to deal with the problems that are thrown at humankind. One such treaty is the Rome Statute which was established with the objective of ensuring justice to all. The status quo makes the discussion of the treaty more relevant now than ever.

      This article will discuss in depth the purpose of the Rome Statute and how the different organs created under its ambit help enhance that purpose.
      
      The Rome Statute
      The Rome Statute is nothing but an effort that focuses on the advocacy of human rights and the promotion of international justice to ensure world peace. The treaty was adopted at the United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries held in Rome, Italy on 17th, 1998, but only came into force on 1st, 2002, with over 120 countries being party to the treaty. The Rome Statute consists of 13 parts and 128 Articles; the Preamble is based on the recognition of the atrocities that humans face that threaten the peace and security of the world at large, and the treaty serves as a means of resolution of these atrocities.
      
      To celebrate the signing of the Rome Statute and commemorate this significant effort towards the supremacy of justice and protection of human rights, 17th July is celebrated as World Day for International Justice every year. The Rome Statute is also known as the ‘International Criminal Court Statute’ since it established the International Criminal Court (ICC).
      
      The basic idea behind establishing the ICC was to create an apparatus to tackle crimes that affect the international community. Additionally, the Rome Statute also establishes the Assembly of State Parties and the Trust Fund for Victims, both of which act as catalysts for the proper functioning of the ICC. All of these organs that find their origin in the Rome Statute are discussed in this article.
      
      Objective of the Rome Statute
      The world was confronted with an extensive increase in atrocities against humanity, especially after World War II, making the entire international community desperate for justice and having to rebuild the world so torn apart by war. It became an immediate priority to prosecute those committing heinous crimes, which came to be referred to as ‘crimes against humanity’. However, state adjudication mechanisms were not considered credible to cater to international violations of humanitarian law. As a result, an initiative was taken by the international community to combat the worst possible atrocities known to humankind and create an interconnected platform to deal with such crimes at a global level. Subsequently, the Rome Statute came into being, which further established the ICC to prevent the most severe crimes from going unpunished and enhance respect for international law. 
      
      History of the Rome Statute
      The road to the Rome Statute was long and included many trials and errors. The intent to create a global platform for dealing with global crimes dates back to the early 19th century. Soon after World War II, efforts were made to create a permanent court for crimes against humanity, but failed. The United Nations General Assembly(UNGA) adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948 to try criminals by an international tribunal and further invited the International Law Commission (ILC) to establish a more permanent structure to try people accused of genocide. The ILC drafted such a statute, but this initiative was eventually abandoned. The Croat–Bosniak War, which led to the commission of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide, pushed the UN Security Council to establish two ad hoc tribunals to try these crimes. However, a need for a more permanent structure was felt. The International Law Commission (ILC) 1994 presented its final draft for the ICC and asked for a conference to be convened for evaluation of the statute and subsequent enactment. 
      
      For this purpose, the General Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, which met twice in 1995. After analysing the report of the above committee, a Preparatory Committee was formulated by the UNGC to consolidate the draft finally. For two years, starting in 1996 to 1998, a total of six meetings were held by the Preparatory Committee in this regard. The United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries, also known as the Rome Conference, took place from 15th June till 17th July 1998 with participation from over 160 governments. At last, 120 nations voted in favor of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and 7 nations against the same which included the United States, Israel, China, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Qatar. After heightened emotional deliberation and discussion, the Rome Statute was finally established on the 17th of July, 1998. As of today, 123 states are party to the Rome Statute.`,

      "Why India does not need a Uniform Civil Code against popular belief",
    thumbnail: "/img/blog2.jpg",
    content: [
      `The concept of Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) is not a new one. Our Constituent Assembly borrowed the DPSPs from the Irish Constitution of 1937, which was borrowed by them from the Spanish Constitution. Chapter IV of the Constitution of India defines DPSP (Article 36-51). These are policies that the State needs to implement for the overall betterment of society. 

      Article 44 of Chapter IV states that “The State shall endeavour to secure the citizens a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) throughout the territory of India.” Though Article 37 says that the DPSPs shall not be enforceable by any court. 
      
      Currently, personal laws are governed by scriptures. A UCC will encode all those personal laws within itself which will then apply to all citizens regardless of their religion.
      
      The UCC has been in talks due to the BJP’s election mandate along with various observations done by the Supreme Court in cases like Sarla Mudgal & others. v. UOI, 1995, Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum, 1985, and Ms. Jordan Diengdeh v. S.S. Chopra, 1985.
      
      This article tries to bring forth the inherent problems that a UCC might bring if done hastily and without taking into account the individual practices of all religions present in India; and their effects thereof which will mainly be endured by women. 
      
      Brief history of UCC in India
      The first ever law commission in India was established in the year 1834. It was constituted under Section 53 of the Charter Act of 1833, with Lord Macaulay as its head. The non-Hindus and non-Muslims living in presidency areas had their laws. However, there were no laws for non-Hindus and non-Muslims living in the mofussil areas. This led to a lot of uncertainty regarding the applicability of substantive civil laws to Anglo-Indians, Armenians, and Christians. The commission submitted the Lex Loci Report in which it recommended implementing substantive civil law of England as a uniform Act. This act was to apply to all non-Hindus and non-Muslims living in the mofussil area. Thus, this led to the birth of UCC in India. 
      
      Later due to the pressure from the Muslim elite, the Shariat law of 1937 was passed. Under this Act, all Indian Muslims are to be governed by Islamic Laws on succession and inheritance, marriage, adoption, divorce and maintenance. 
      
      Under the Hindu law committee during the 1948–1951 and 1951–1954 sessions, a talk for implementation of UCC took birth.  Dr B. R. Ambedkar was a huge supporter of UCC and believed that only UCC will reform the Hindu society and provide protection to Muslim women, who have little to no protection under the Sharia Law. But after receiving a lot of criticism, a lesser version of the bill was passed in 1956. The Bill was divided into 4 acts namely, Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956.
      We see rising demand from all parts of the country for a Uniform Civil Code. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election manifesto has pledged to bring into force the UCC. The main misconception regarding personal laws is that they are invincible and aren’t subject to judicial review. Thus, UCC is the only option left to filter out all discriminatory practices in personal laws. The truth is all laws whether personal or criminal or financial are judicially reviewable and the judiciary can declare them potentially void if they encroach upon Fundamental Rights. 

The only exception to the present rule of judicial review is that the laws aren’t codified under Indian law and are derived from a different legal system. Here, understanding Article 13 of the Constitution becomes essential. Article 13 of the Indian Constitution defines law and declares them void if they abridge, violates or contravenes any provision of Part III. Quite shockingly, in the judgement of State of Bombay v. Narasu Appa Mali,1952, the HC decided that personal laws are not “laws” within the meaning of Article 13 and thus won’t be included in the ambit of Fundamental Rights enshrined under Part III (Article 12-35) of the Constitution. What the judgement essentially does is to keep the personal laws how-so-much arbitrary or violate fundamental rights away from judicial scrutiny. Other judgments where the Supreme Court held the same principle are Krishna Singh vs Mathura Ahir, 1980, Maharshi Avdesh case, 1994, and the Ahmedabad Women Action Group case of 1997. But, in 1996 a three-Judge SC bench in the case of Mudaliar held personal laws to be void if they are violative of fundamental rights. Still, the judgement of Narasu Appa Mali has not been overruled and the ghost of Narasu Appa still looms. 

Another example is the Sharia law, this Islamic law is derived from the Islamic religious legal system and not from the Indian Constitution and thus is exempt from judicial review. 

But we have seen time and again in landmark rulings such as that of Shamim Ara and Daniel Latifi how the legislation protected women’s rights under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 by interpreting the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005. In these cases, too, however, the stand taken by the SC is that it’s not required for the personal laws to be in accordance with the principles enshrined in the Fundamental Rights of the Indian Constitution.

The real problems we need to address
India is a pluralistic country with diverse cultural practices, and a uniform civil code relating to marriage, divorce, and succession, in reality, is not feasible. Though the judiciary in recent times through judicial activism is trying to bring some uniformity among various personal laws.

The most famous judgment is that of Shah Bano. According to muslin personal law, the maintenance paid by the ex-husband is only during the period of iddat (waiting period after divorce) and Mehr. But the Supreme Court rejected this argument and directed Shah Bano’s husband to pay maintenance according to the laws applicable to other Indians.

Another example is that of the Triple Talaq case in 2002 it was held that the Muslim man does not have a unilateral right to divorce his wife by triple talaq. He is bound to prove the same in a court of law. 

Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
According to this act, any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu law or any custom or any usage, either before the immediate commencement ceases to be in effect. But the ground reality of this is very different.

Many rural communities do not follow this Act, because they are more comfortable deciding such disputes based on their community traditions and practices. Even women from such communities prefer to go to the local panchayats rather than formal courts and the reasons could range from them being too alien, distant, and expensive to the time that the courts take to deliver judgements. 

And as the issues of marriage, divorce and succession are civil, chances are that even after enacting a UCC, many tribal and rural communities may not follow it and continue with their own tribal or customary practices. 

So, to bring uniformity and bring equality we need to solve the root problems. This could be solved either by spreading awareness or devising ways for the formal courts to deliver speedy remedies. The enormous delays and huge backlogs will force people to follow their customary practices for quick redressal of the problem with which they are familiar.

Similar to this, there are several discriminatory practices within the different personal laws. The Lata Mittal case of 1985 is a perfect example of this.  She won a 20-year legal battle which led to Hindu daughters being given equal rights in ancestral property. Before, joint-heirship in parental property was not given to Hindu daughters.

      "[The Viewpoint] Analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in Vidarbha Industries",
    thumbnail: "/img/blog3.jpg",
    content: [
      `The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) marked a monumental change in the landscape of insolvency and has been more effective than any of its predecessors. The reason for the success of this Code has been the push for resolution over liquidation, and the emphasis on timelines in the insolvency process.


      Despite its effectiveness, the Code has still been unable to achieve the ambitious timelines, and the primary reason for this is the litigation surrounding the Code. There are numerous contradictory judgments of the courts that convolute the understanding of even the most basic concepts under the Code.
      
      One such decision is the recent decision in the case of Vidarbha Industries v. Axis Bank. The Supreme Court in this case held that under a Section 7 application for initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), the Adjudicating Authority (AA) has the discretion to not admit the insolvency application despite the existence of a debt or default on the part of the Corporate Debtor. This is a drastic change to the existing jurisprudence of the Code as till now, it was a settled proposition that the IBC allows initiation of insolvency proceedings with just a default in payment of debt above the threshold limit.
      
      This piece will analyse the decision and highlight how it is contrary to the history and intention of the Code, as well as the principles of interpretation of statues.
      
      Overview of the decision
      
      Axis Bank (creditor) filed a Section 7 application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for instituting the CIRP against Vidarbha Industries (corporate debtor/CD). The application was opposed by the CD, which argued that it had a favourable order against Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, for an amount higher than the defaulted amount. The NCLT and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) both rejected this contention noting that there existed a debt and a default which was not disputed by the CD.
      
      However, the Supreme Court overturned the decision and held that the AA has the discretion to not admit an application filed under Section 7 of IBC, despite the existence of a debt and undisputed default. Further, the Court remanded the matter to the NCLT for fresh consideration and asked it to note that the CD had a favourable order for ₹1,750 crores, which is much higher than the amount due to the creditor.
      
      Against the intent of Bankruptcy Law Review Committee (B
      
      The BLRC Report is one of the most critical documents to understand the interpretation and intention of provisions of the IBC. The BLRC under the heading “5.2.2 How can the IRP be triggered?”, discusses that the trigger point to be adopted for financial creditors under the IBC is the existence of default on payment. The Code presupposes that instituting insolvency is the final resolve and at this stage, all that the AA has to look into is whether the application is complete and whether there is existence of default. It states,
      
      "In case the financial creditor triggers the IRP, the Adjudicator verifies the default from the information utility (if the default has been filed with an information utility, tit such be incontrovertible evidence of the existence of a default) or otherwise confirms the existence of default through the additional evidence adduced by the financial creditor, and puts forward the proposal for the RP to the Regulator for validation."
      
      Thus, the interpretation adopted by the Supreme Court clearly contradicts the legislative intent.
      
      Furthermore, the Court's interpretation essentially brings back the approach of the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA), which was repealed by the IBC. One of the main reasons for the failure of SICA was that there were huge delays within the process. Under SICA, the insolvency process would commence once the now defunct Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) had determined that the company was sick and needed resolution. This determination of whether a company was sick or not itself used to take a lot of time, which led to delaying the process. This, along with intervention from various courts, led to the insolvency process stretching for years; thereby reducing value of the CD.
      
      The IBC was introduced to ensure that such issues do not arise again. However, the decision of the Supreme Court takes the IBC back to these problems that the SICA had faced. Leaving it to the AA to determine whether a company needs to undergo the insolvency requires a detailed analysis of its financial capacity, which will not only cause enormous delay in the admission stage, but is also beyond the purview of the AA’s expertise and jurisdiction.
      
      "May" can mean "shall"
      
      The crux of the Supreme Court’s reasoning was that Section 7(5) of the IBC uses the word "may", and a literal interpretation of the provision suggests that the AA can decide not to admit the application despite fulfilment of all the prerequisites mentioned in the provision. The Court observed that literal interpretation is the primary rule of interpretation, so where there is no ambiguity, the words used in the statute must be given effect to. This analysis of the Supreme Court is only partially correct, as it fails to consider that "may" in some situations can also impose an obligation. There are situations where "may" has to be read as "shall"; thereby imposing an obligation to act a certain way.
      
      To determine the interpretation of "may", one must look at the context of the provision and see if the ordinary meaning of the word would make the legislation redundant, or if it would give unbridled power that may lead to arbitrariness. In the present case, reading "may" as being discretionary makes the provision redundant and gives unguided power to AA that would lead to arbitrariness.
      
      The IBC was introduced to provide an effective legal framework for timely resolution of such disputes. The focus of the process is on value maximisation through timely resolution of business; hence, time is of the essence under the IBC. To ensure that there are fewer delays, the Code has reduced the amount of judicial intervention in the process and has adopted a creditor in control model. Further, the Code permits only a limited and narrow scope of interference by the AA. By making the AA undertake an analysis of the financial strength of the CD, the decision of the Supreme Court has led to delaying the process of initiation of insolvency and has also increased the scope of intervention.
      
      Further, there is nothing in the Code to provide any guidance as to the factors to be considered by the AA when deciding whether or not to admit an application. Section 7 only talks about existence of default, and the Resolution Professional (RP) being eligible. Once these factors are fulfilled, there is nothing in Section 7 or in the Code that provides when the AA should not admit the insolvency application. The decision of the Supreme Court has vested the adjudicatory authority with powers that are not provided under the IBC, and that too without any guidance on when and how to exercise the same. Hence, looking at the intention and scheme of the Code, we see that section 7(5) uses "may" as "shall" and must be interpreted in the same manner.
      
      Conclusion
      
      The Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 7(5) of IBC in the Vidarbha Industries case looked at the provision in a vacuum and disregarded the history and intention of the Code. Furthermore, the decision operates on a misplaced reliance on literal interpretation and fails to consider the established principles of interpretation of statues. The facts of Vidarbha Industries do warrant a fair consideration, but the same could be done by the Supreme Court through its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.
      
      The route taken by the Court sets a new and incorrect position of law, which also provides precedent value to future litigation. By putting default as the trigger, it was envisaged that the IBC would also bring a change in the payment culture of India. However, the interpretation adopted by the Supreme Court will have wide ramifications on the effectiveness of the IBC and the changes it sought to bring within the commercial sector.

      "The Viewpoint: Twitter v. Musk dispute has highlighted the importance of efficient contracting",
    thumbnail: "/img/blog4.jpg",
    content: [
      `Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are strategic business collaborations that form an indispensable part of the corporate world. Parties have to mutually consent upon key terms and considerations regarding the target’s business before closing the deal.

      Legally speaking, the ongoing dispute between Twitter and Elon Musk (Musk) in the Delaware Chancery Court has given prominence to the contractual nuances prevalent in M&A deals with special attention on the Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clause. Typically, acquisition agreements include clauses which safeguard the interests of the contracting parties. One such clause is MAE, which is a ground for the acquirer to terminate a transaction on the occurrence of a materially adverse event that puts the acquirer’s commercial interest in jeopardy.
      
      
      Generally, a MAE clause envisages broad circumstances or events, whose adverse consequences make the transaction untenable. These may include events that have a materially adverse impact on the target business itself, or the ability of the parties to perform their obligations and consummate the transaction, or the ability of the acquirer to carry on the target’s business post-acquisition. MAE clauses are heavily negotiated and differ depending on the facts and industry requirements of each deal. While acquirers seek to retain broad definitions, sellers seek to include qualitative and quantitative constraints to protect their own interests.
      
      In the ongoing Twitter v. Musk feud, the following developments have taken place:
      
      (1) Musk has terminated the merger agreement to acquire Twitter by claiming that Twitter has made materially inaccurate representations (especially in relation to fake Twitter accounts), which allegedly result in a materially adverse event triggering the MAE clause.
      
      (2) Twitter, on its part, has denied Musk’s claims of misrepresentation and challenged the termination. Twitter has alleged that Musk is seeking to walk away from the transaction due to a market downturn and subsequent fall in the stock price. Twitter has relied on the qualitative thresholds in the MAE clause to argue that a market downturn does not trigger the MAE clause.
      
      In India, there is a scarcity of judicial decisions on the enforceability of MAE clauses, especially as many such disputes end up in arbitrations which are confidential in nature and not in public courts of law. However, the provisions of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 (“Takeover Code”) provide some guidance in the form of Regulation 23 which provides statutory grounds for withdrawal of a takeover offer. Accordingly, an offer for takeover can be withdrawn if a condition mentioned in the acquisition agreement attracting the obligation to make the open offer is not met for reasons outside the reasonable control of the acquirer. A similar provision in the predecessor to the Takeover Code i.e., SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, has been interpreted by the Indian judiciary to be restricted only to instances of legal and natural impossibility. Poor financial performance of the target entity is, typically, not permitted as a legitimate ground for invoking this provision.
      
      The Takeover Code, however, applies only to listed companies. For private or unlisted public companies in India, there are no guiding statutory provisions. Hence, everything boils down to negotiations and the contractual understanding between the parties.
      
      American jurisprudence, however, provides some legal literature on this subject. In Re IBP, Inc. Shareholders Litigation v. Tyson Foods, Inc., the broadly worded MAE clause included events affecting the financial condition, business, assets, liabilities and results of operations of the target and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Delaware court interpreted this clause to mean a substantial threat to the overall long-term earning potential of the acquirer and not just applicable to mere short-term setbacks. The court also relied on past negotiations and conduct of the acquirer in its interpretation of the clause. In Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi, the Delaware court permitted the termination as the acquirer had complied with all its obligations and its conduct showed an intent to close the deal. In this case, the court also introduced a test of quantitative and qualitative materiality to invoke the MAE clause to safeguard the seller.
      
      M&A deals in India are at an all-time high, especially in the startup space which is attracting the interest of well-established conglomerates too. While regulatory, legislative and even judicial guidance is scare domestically, there are some lessons to be learned from this foreign dispute. Even as proceedings are sub judice, certain key aspects should be kept in mind by parties to a M&A deal: (1) MAE clauses should be drafted with care to accurately capture the commercial intent of the parties. Boilerplate MAE clauses should be avoided. (2) Termination may only be permitted if the MAE has a substantial impact on the transaction. General stock market downturns may not save the day. (3) Further, the conduct of the parties between signing and closing can play a key role in determining if a MAE clause is being invoked unreasonably. It is also suggested that parties should be proactive and get their existing arrangements legally reviewed for risk mitigation.
      
      In conclusion, this dispute has highlighted the importance of efficient contracting, especially to resolve future conflicts when the parties may no longer be on the same page. Lastly, we can expect the Delaware court to give a precedent-setting judgement, which will have the potential to change the course of future M&A deals in India and the world over.
