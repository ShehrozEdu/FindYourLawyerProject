      "description": "Republicans have branded the move as a 'gun grab'.",
      "content": "Congress voted to revive a ban on many semi-automatic firearms which expired in 2004 (Picture: AFP/Getty Images) The House has passed legislation reviving a ban on certain semi-automatic firearms in response to hundreds of mass shootings in the US this year. It was the first vote of its kind in years and has been dismissed by Republicans as a ‘gun grab’ that will curtail American’s freedom. Once banned in the US, high powered semi-automatic assault rifles are now the weapon of choice for young men behind the most devastating mass shootings. Congress allowed the restrictions first put in place in 1994 on the manufacture and sales of the weapons to expire a decade later. It was unable to muster the political support to counter the powerful gun lobby and reinstate the weapons ban. Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed the vote toward passage in the Democratic-run House, saying the earlier ban ‘saved lives’. Hailing yesterday’s House vote, President Joe Biden said: ‘The majority of the American people agree with this common sense action.’ The POTUS urged the Senate to ‘move quickly to get this bill to my desk’, but it is likely to stall in the 50-50 upper chamber. But the new bill is likely to fail in the Senate as Republicans rally against the move (Picture: EPA) Republicans are shunning the legislation, dismissing it as an election-year strategy by Democrats. Almost all GOP members voted against the House bill, which passed 217-213. The bill comes at a time of intensifying concerns about gun violence and shootings, including the supermarket shooting in Buffalo, the massacre of school children in Uvalde, and the July Fourth shootings in Highland Park. Voters seem to be taking such election-year votes seriously as Congress splits along party lines and lawmakers are forced to go on the record with their views. A recent vote to protect same-sex marriages from potential Supreme Court legal challenges won a surprising amount of bipartisan support. Biden was instrumental in helping secure the first semi-automatic weapons ban as a senator in 1994. His administration said that for 10 years, while the ban was in place, mass shootings declined. ‘When the ban expired in 2004, mass shootings tripled,’ his office said in a statement. President Joe Biden said mass shootings ‘tripled’ when the previous ban expired (Picture: Reuters) Republicans stood firmly against limits on ownership of the high-powered firearms during an at times emotional debate ahead of voting. ‘It’s a gun grab, pure and simple,’ said Pennsylvania representative Guy Reschenthaler. Gun store owner and Georgia representative Andrew Clyde added: ‘An armed America is a safe and free America.’ Democrats argued that the ban on the weapons makes sense, portraying Republicans as extreme and out of step with Americans. Massachusetts Democratic representative Jim McGovern said the weapons ban is not about taking away Americans’ Second Amendment rights. Rather, he said it was about ensuring that children also have the right ‘to not get shot in school’. Pelosi displayed a poster of a gun company’s advertisement for children’s weapons. She said the idea of smaller versions resembling popular AR-15 rifles being marketed with cartoon-like characters is ‘disgusting’. The gun lobby has dismissed the move as a power grab (Picture: AFP/Getty Images) ‘Your freedom stops where mine begins, and that of my constituents begins,’ Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur told Republican Jim Jordan in a tense exchange. ‘Schools, shopping malls, grocery stores, Independence Day parades shouldn’t be scenes of mass carnage and bloodshed,’ she said. Jordan replied by inviting her to his congressional district to debate him on the Second Amendment. He said he believed most of his constituents ‘probably agree with me and agree with the United States Constitution’. The bill would make it unlawful to import, sell or manufacture a long list of semi-automatic weapons. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat representing New York, said it includes an exemption that allows for the possession of existing semi-automatic guns. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hit out at ‘disgusting’ marketing of smaller-sized weapons for children (Picture: AP) Reps. Chris Jacobs of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania were the only Republicans to vote for the measure. The Democratic lawmakers voting no were Reps. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Jared Golden of Maine, Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas. For nearly two decades, since the previous ban expired Democrats had been reluctant to revisit the issue and confront the gun lobby. But voter opinions appear to be shifting and Democrats dared to act before the fall election. NRA Institute for Legislative Action executive director Jason Quimet said gun control advocates are ‘spearheading an assault upon the freedoms and civil liberties of law-abiding Americans’. He said the bill potentially bans millions of firearms ‘in blatant opposition to the Supreme Court’s rulings’ that have established gun ownership as an individual right and expanded on it. Among the semi-automatic weapons banned would be some 200-plus types of semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s, and pistols. The restrictions would not apply to many other models. Democrats had tried to link the weapons ban to a broader package of public safety measures that would have increased federal funding for law enforcement. It’s something centrist Democrats in tough re-election campaigns wanted to shield them from political attacks by their Republican opponents they are soft on crime. Pelosi said the House will revisit the public safety bills in August when lawmakers are expected to return briefly to Washington to handle other remaining legislation. Congress passed a modest gun violence prevention package just last month in the aftermath of the tragic shooting of 19 school children and two teachers in Uvalde. UK street lights could be dimmed ‘in Germany-style blackout’ to save energy That bipartisan bill was the first of its kind after years of failed efforts to confront the gun lobby, including after a similar 2012 mass tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. It provides for expanded background checks on young adults buying firearms, allowing authorities to access certain juvenile records. The law also closes the so-called ‘boyfriend loophole’ by denying gun purchases for those convicted of domestic abuse outside of marriages. It also frees up federal funding to the states, including for ‘red flag’ laws that enable authorities to remove guns from those who would harm themselves or others. But there’s still plenty of uncertainty over the future of gun rights in the US. Biden signed the measure two days after the Supreme Court’s ruling striking down a New York law that restricted people’s ability to carry concealed weapons.

      "content": "The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has attached fresh assets worth over Rs 110 crore in connection with its money laundering probe against Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL), its CMD C Parthasarathy and others. The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it has attached fresh assets worth over Rs 110 crore in connection with its money laundering probe against Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL), its CMD C Parthasarathy and others. The money-laundering case was filed based on FIRs by the Hyderabad Police on the complaints of lending banks who alleged the Karvy Group had availed large amounts of loans by illegally pledging their clients' shares worth about Rs 2,800 crore and the said loans have become non performing asset (NPA) after the release of the client's securities as per the orders of NSE and SEBI. 'In order to safeguard the proceeds of crime from alienation, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified and attached movable assets totalling Rs 110.70 crore,' the probe agency said in a statement. With the latest order, the total attachment of properties by the ED in this case stands at Rs 2,095 crore. 'KSBL was one of the leading stock brokers in the country with millions of clients. The scam came to light after a limited purpose inspection of KSBL conducted by the NSE in 2019 revealed that KSBL had not revealed a DP Account and credited the funds raised by pledging of client securities to 6 of its own bank accounts (Stock Broker-own Account) instead of the stock broker-client account,' the ED had said earlier. It arrested Parthasarathy, group CFO G Krishna Hari in January this year as part of the probe. Both are out on bail now. A 'very complex web' of financial transactions, using several shell entities and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), have been executed to conceal the source of these funds to project them as untainted funds, the ED had said. 'Parthasarthy had made arrangement through his group companies to pay financial benefits to his sons Rajat Parthasarthy and Adhiraj Parthasarthy in the garb of salary and reimbursement of household expenses and thus the proceeds of crime were projected as untainted money in the hands of the family members,' the ED alleged. It claimed the probe found that V Mahesh, MD of KDMSL (a related company) senior official and key management personnel of the Karvy group, is a close associate of Parthasarthy and he 'actively assisted and planned the execution of money laundering operations'.",

C’è … L'articolo Ripple pubblica il report Q2 | Novità per NFT e causa contro SEC proviene da Criptovaluta.it.",
      "content": "Arriva il report trimestrale di Ripple ed è il momento, per il gruppo che gestisce questo progetto, di tirare le somme sulla prima metà del 2022 . Lo scenario è ancora dominato dalla causa che vede contrapposta Ripple Labs a SEC anche se non è questo l’unico angolo interessante al quale guardare tramite il report. C’è tanto, anzi tantissimo che sta avvenendo dalle parti di Ripple anche in termini di adozione e di accordi commerciali , che continuano almeno fuori dagli USA come se niente fosse e come se l’ingombrante causa con SEC non fosse mai esistita. Report che segnala ancora una volta la forza anche di $XRP , sul quale possiamo anche investire con eToro – vai qui per ottenere un conto virtuale gratuito e privo di limitazioni – intermediario che ci permette di investire su 75+ token e cripto scelte tutte tra le migliori in termini di prospettiva futura. Strumenti come il CopyTrader che permette la copia dei migliori trader o di spiarli rendono questo intermediario assolutamente unico. E chi preferisce invece degli investimenti diversificati può fare affidamento sugli Smart Portfolios , che permettono di accedere per quote a panieri cripto in stile ETF . Con 50$ possiamo poi passare ad un conto reale. Il report trimestrale di Ripple: cosa bolle in pentola Ripple è forse insieme ad Algorand la realtà commercialmente più strutturata del settore blockchain for business e non è dunque strano vedere che vengano pubblicati, in linea totale con quanto fanno le grandi imprese, dei report trimestrali che facciano il punto non solo finanziario dell’intero ecosistema. Il Report di Ripple Ci sono tante novità , dagli accordi con FLUF World per lo sviluppo di una nuova blockchain che andrà sotto il nome di Root Network e che si integrerà con Ripple pienamente e utilizzerà anche $XRP come pagamento per le fee . Ci sono anche aggiornamenti sul cammino di XRP Ledger nel mondo dei token non fungibili , cammino ormai avviato da tempo e che punta sulla carbon neutrality del network per spingersi anche a livello corporate. Ed è in questo ambito, ci racconta il report, che è stato siglato un accordo con Lotus , che porterà il celebra marchio di supercar ad entrare nel Web3 proprio grazie ai servizi offerti da Ripple . Sono queste e tante altre le novità che possiamo trovare direttamente sul report , dispaccio che dovrebbe essere letto, anzi attentamente studiato da tutti coloro i quali vogliono effettivamente affacciarsi al mondo di XRP , o che hanno già investito su quello che è un token che rimane di grande interesse anche per gli speculatori e per gli investitori di lungo periodo. Gli aggiornamenti sulla causa legale con SEC Rimane di enorme importanza la valutazione della causa legale che vede contrapposta Ripple Labs a SEC , in una delle querelle legali più importanti per tutto il comparto. Ripple conferma quanto è emerso nelle ultime settimane: un attacco frontale a SEC e al suo comportamento in tribunale, strategia che è valsa nelle ultime sedute anche il chiaro appoggio del giudice che presiede la causa. Garlinghouse , leader del gruppo, continua a definire il comportamento di SEC come regulation by enforcement , ovvero regolamentazione tramite cause legali: non esattamente ideale per un settore che è ancora agli albori e soprattutto non ideale per un paese che dovrebbe essere governato dalla Rule of Law . Protesto, in soldoni, per l’applicazione di regole che non sono soltanto poco chiare, ma che vengono applicate diversamente da soggetto a soggetto. Critiche che, qualunque sia il nostro atteggiamento verso Ripple , vanno sicuramente riconosciute come concrete e reali , ovvero polemiche che hanno un fondo di grande verità. Con la certezza che, una volta passata la burrasca legale, $XRP potrebbe tornare ad essere scambiato su livelli molto più interessanti di quelli di oggi.",

In pursuance of the recommendations of the Lee Commission appointed in the year 1923, the Federal Public Service Commission was established for the Government of India in the year 1926. The Lee Commission had effectively put forth the necessity of the Commission. Therein,it was emphasised that for effective civil service, it was necessry for it to get protection from political and private influence and that, for that purpose it was necessary to have Public Service Commission for the State. Nevertheless,the Government of India Act, 1919 was silent on setting up Province-wise Public Service Commission. However, the Lee Commission had also recommended that for keeping control over the recruitment and in order to curtail the political influence, the Provinces should enact a law for their own respective Public Service Commission.In pursuance thereof, Madras Province took initiative and it was the first Province to enact a law in the year 1929 and to set up a Provincial Public Service Commission.
